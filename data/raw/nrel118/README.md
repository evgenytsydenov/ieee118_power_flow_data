# NREL-118 Dataset

The dataset contains the information about the IEEE-118 power system with
 several modifications (aka "NREL-118"), which are presented and described
 [in the paper "An Extended IEEE 118-Bus Test System With High Renewable
 Penetration"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7904729).
