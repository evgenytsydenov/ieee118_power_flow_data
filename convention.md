## Naming

### Buses

- "bus_name" --- bus name in form "bus_<number>"
- "region" --- name of region where the bus is located
- "in_service" --- if the bus is in service (not in maintenance)

- "parallel" --- number of the branch in parallel branches
- "in_service" --- if the branch is in service (not in maintenance)
- "r_ohm" --- branch resistance in ohms
- "x_ohm" --- branch reactance in ohms
- "b_Âµs" --- branch reactive conductance in microsiemens
- "trafo_ratio_rel" --- transformation ratio (relative to the ratio of voltage levels of the high and low sides) if the branch is a transformer
